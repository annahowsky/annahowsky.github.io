# About Me
I'm Anna.

I am a Seattle-based dabbler with an enthusiasm for just about anything. My current hobbies are weightlifting, gardening, swimming, and hiking. 
Some of my recent escapades include crochet, climbing, cooking, singing, playing piano, birdwatching, language learning, video games and so on....

I'm a lifelong learner and always ready to dive headfirst into the next rabbit hole.

For now I am dusting off my coding and math skills in preparation for an exciting new era - powered by curiosity!
